# PWA Blog template using ReactJs and Material UI

This is a template PWA - Progresive Web Application that uses ReactJs and Material UI. Currently I've done the development in a subfolder ('/pwa/'). To run in the root folder just remove the ("homepage": "/pwa/",) in the package.json file. (Also remove the "set HOST=intranet&& " from scripts->start property in package.json)

Store is managed using React's Context API.

Steps to install and start playing with the project:

1. git clone https://github.com/edisonneza/react_blog.git
2. npm i
3. npm run start

To generate build files (by removing the source map files) 

1. npm run winBuild
